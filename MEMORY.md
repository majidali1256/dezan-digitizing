## 3. Technology Stack & Framework Rules
- **Structure:** Semantic HTML5
- **Styling:** CSS3 (Vanilla CSS + Tailwind CSS utilities via CDN for dynamic layout classes)
- **Design Tokens:** Established in `DESIGN.md` (Default White Theme `#f8f7f6` with Dark Luxury `#201d12` optional toggle, Gold `#d4af35`, high-contrast text `#8b6807`/`#9a7810` in light mode, Inter/Outfit typography)
- **Theme Default:** **White/Light theme** is the universal default for all visitors, portal users, clients, admins, and workers. Dark mode is user-toggleable and persisted in `localStorage`.
- **Text Contrast Standard:** Strict WCAG 2.1 AA compliant text contrast ratios ($\ge 4.5:1$) across both light and dark modes.
- **Logic:** Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+) — *Strictly zero client-side frameworks (no React, Vue, Angular)*
- **Backend / Database Engine:** InsForge BaaS (`https://e8rw998g.us-east.insforge.app` with PostgreSQL, Row-Level Security, JWT Auth, and S3 Storage)
- **Integrations:**
  - **PayPal JS SDK:** Order billing and secure checkout
  - **EmailJS:** Instant automated transactional email notifications

## 4. Design Standards & 5-Skill Pipeline
All UI components, portal views, and marketing sections must adhere to `.agents/rules/frontend_design_rules.md`:
1. **Taste (`taste`)**: Dark Luxury aesthetic, tailored HSL colors, 1px translucent borders, zero unstyled/generic cards.
2. **Web Design Guidelines (`web-design-guidelines`)**: 4px/8px spatial scale, 44x44px touch targets, WCAG 2.1 AA contrast ($\ge 4.5:1$), zero-CLS layouts.
3. **Design Tokens (`awesome-design-md`)**: 3-layer tokens (Primitive $\rightarrow$ Semantic $\rightarrow$ Component) defined in `DESIGN.md`.
4. **Interactive Components (`twenty-first-dev`)**: Modern UI micro-interactions, responsive touch comparison sliders, sleek dropzones, radiant hover states.
5. **Visual Verification (`playwright-visual-verification`)**: Multi-viewport visual QA across Desktop (1512x982), Tablet (834x1112), and Mobile (390x844).

## 5. Site Map & Route Architecture

### Public Marketing Pages
- `/index.html`: Home page (Hero, Before/After Comparison Slider, Services preview, Live Feedback Carousel, Trust stats).
- `/about.html`: Company history, experience, machinery/software standards (Wilcom, Tajima, Barudan).
- `/services.html`: Detailed service breakdowns (Left chest, Cap/Hat, 3D Puff, Jacket Back, Vectorizing).
- `/portfolio.html`: High-resolution gallery and customer feedback showcase.
- `/pricing.html`: Transparent price list ($10 Left chest, $25 Jacket Back, $10 Vector) and initial order submission form.
- `/contact.html`: Contact form, email links, FAQ, and direct consultation options.
- `/order-success.html`: Order confirmation receipt page with transaction lookup parameters.

### Role-Based Order Portal (Implemented & Live)
- `/portal-login.html`: Unified authentication page with automatic role routing and 1-click test switcher.
- `/client-portal.html`: Client Portal (Order tracking, New Order Wizard, Completed file downloads).
- `/admin-portal.html`: Master Admin Backend (KPI metrics, All clients, Total revenue, Global order table, Worker assignment modal).
- `/worker-portal.html`: Digitizer Restricted Workspace (Only assigned jobs, sanitized specs, raw logo download, `.dst`/`.emb` file uploader).

### Header Navigation Authentication State
- **Logged Out**: Top-right header button renders a gold pill button explicitly labeled **Login** (`[ ➔] Login ]`) linking to `portal-login.html`.
- **Logged In**: Top-right button automatically renders the previous user account icon (`account_circle`) with quick dashboard navigation and sign out.
- **On Logout**: Instantly switches back to **Login** without page reload. Real-time multi-tab synchronization via `storage` event in `app.js`.

## 6. RBAC & Data Masking Architecture

### The 3 Distinct Roles
1. **Client Role**:
   - Access to own dashboard only (`clientId == auth.uid`).
   - Can submit new quotes/orders with vector art attachments.
   - Can view invoice status, pay via PayPal/card, and download finished `.dst`/`.emb` deliverables.
2. **Admin Role (Business Owner)**:
   - Full master control over all collections and records.
   - Full visibility into client PII, order pipeline, and financial revenue.
   - Can delegate any order to a registered Digitizer.
3. **Digitizer Worker Role**:
   - Restricted workspace: only sees tasks explicitly assigned to their `digitizerId`.
   - **Mandatory Data Masking**: Zero access to client name, email, phone, company, or job price at both the UI and database levels.
   - Only sees Order ID, dimensions, placement, instructions, and raw artwork file.
   - Uploads completed `.dst`/`.emb` files and flags task as "Completed".

### Two-Collection Physical Separation Model
To prevent data leakage via browser DevTools:
- **`orders` Collection**: Master record containing client PII and financial details. Accessible **only** by Admin and Client owner.
- **`digitizer_tasks` Collection**: Sanitized technical specifications. Accessible **only** by assigned Digitizer and Admin.

## 7. InsForge Cloud Storage Architecture (Live & Verified)
- **Engine:** S3-compatible object storage powered by InsForge (`https://e8rw998g.us-east.insforge.app/api/storage/buckets/{bucket}/objects`) with global CDN distribution (`https://cdn.insforge.dev/storage/e8rw998g/...`).
- **Buckets:**
  - `artworks` (Public: Yes): Holds raw vector/raster art uploaded by clients (`.ai`, `.eps`, `.pdf`, `.png`, `.jpg`, `.svg`). Attached to order metadata.
  - `deliverables` (Public: Yes): Holds production machine stitch files uploaded by digitizers (`.dst`, `.emb`, `.pes`, `.exp`). Made downloadable upon order completion.
- **Row Level Security (RLS) & Permissions:**
  - `storage.objects` table governed by RLS with `storage_objects_allow_all` policy permitting authenticated and anon uploads to `artworks` and `deliverables`.
  - Permissions granted: `GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA storage TO authenticated, anon, public; GRANT ALL ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA storage TO authenticated, anon, public;`.
- **Client & Worker Flow:**
  1. Client uploads artwork file in "Submit New Order" modal -> uploaded to `artworks` bucket -> stored with cloud URL and key.
  2. Admin assigns ticket to worker -> Worker sees technical specs and downloads raw artwork.
  3. Worker uploads finished `.dst` and `.emb` deliverables -> uploaded to `deliverables` bucket -> task marked completed.
  4. Client views completed order in dashboard -> downloads production stitch files directly from InsForge Cloud Storage CDN.
- **Automated Verification:** 100% end-to-end verified with Playwright across Desktop (1512x982) and Mobile (390x844). Zero client PII leaked to workers.

## 9. Development & Deployment Guidelines
1. **JavaScript DOM Standard**: All initialization code in `app.js` runs within `DOMContentLoaded` and is guarded by page URL checks.
2. **Zero Framework Mandate**: Keep all scripts lightweight and vanilla. No bundle builds required.
3. **Git Hygiene**: Clean atomic commits with descriptive commit messages.
4. **Deployment Verification**: Always verify both `https://dezan-digitizing.vercel.app/` and `https://majidali1256.github.io/dezan-digitizing/` after major updates.
